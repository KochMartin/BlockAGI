**BlockAGI** is an open-source research agent built with Python3, utilizing the capabilities of [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). BlockAGI conducts iterative, domain-specific research, primarily focused on cryptocurrency but customizable to other domains. It outputs detailed narrative reports to showcase its findings. The progress of the AI agent's work is presented interactively through a user-friendly web interface, allowing users to watch the progress in real-time.

> ü§ñ Initially designed to answer crypto research topics (hence the "Block" in BlockAGI), it has proven useful for a wide variety of other use cases.

## üéØ Features

- **üíØ 100% Hackable**: The code is based on LangChain and comes with a WebUI that's basically just one [`tsx`](/ui/app/page.tsx) file.
- **üõ†Ô∏è Versatile**: BlockAGI can help write professional research pieces using live online or user-proprietary information, search and gather information using tools provided on its own, produce and refine the research piece using new materials found without human supervision, and evaluate itself, generating additional intermediate research topics to fulfill the user's research objectives.
- **üöÄ Inspired by the Best**: BlockAGI leans on multiple predecessors like [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) and [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT) to create a self-improving agent with a specific goal of producing human-readable research pieces with the proper citations.

## üí° Differences from AutoGPT

- **‚ö° Efficiency**: BlockAGI has been tested to work well with `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k`, which is substantially cheaper than `gpt-4` on most research tasks.
- **üñ•Ô∏è Interactive Web UI**: BlockAGI features a Web UI that displays the agent's decision-making process, execution progress, and the latest research results. This allows for a more interactive and user-friendly experience.
- **üéØ Focused Functionality**: BlockAGI is designed with a single goal in mind - to assist users in their research topics. It's not about doing everything, but doing one thing really well.
- **üîß Simplified Setup**: BlockAGI does not require file reading/writing, so there's no need for Docker/sandboxing. This makes the setup process simpler and more straightforward.
- **üì¶ No External Datastore**: BlockAGI does not require an external vector datastore to work, reducing the complexity and resource requirements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Backend: [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/)
- Frontend: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## üîã Installation

To get started with BlockAGI, please follow these steps:

1. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), a dependency management tool for Python.
2. Clone the BlockAGI repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

4. Next, install the [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) dependencies by running the following command:
   ```bash
   poetry run playwright install
   ```

## üéÆ Basic Usage

To start using BlockAGI, please follow these steps:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
2. Open the `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key. You can also modify other configurations as needed, such as the research domain or any additional settings.
3. Run the following command to start BlockAGI:

   ```
   poetry run python main.py
   ```

   This will initiate BlockAGI and also spin up a web application, allowing you to monitor the progress and interact with the research agent.

4. Watch the progress on BlockAGI via the web interface.
