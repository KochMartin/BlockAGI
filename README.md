# ðŸ¤–ðŸ“¦ BlockAGI

BlockAGI is an open-source research agent built with Python3, utilizing the capabilities of [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). BlockAGI conducts iterative, domain-specific research, primarily focused on cryptocurrency but customizable to other domains. It outputs detailed narrative reports to showcase its findings. The progress of the AI agent's work is presented interactively through a user-friendly web interface, allowing users to watch the progress in real-time.

## Installation

   ```bash
   poetry run playwright install
   ```

## Usage

To start using BlockAGI, please follow these steps:
1. Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
