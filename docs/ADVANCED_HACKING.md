# 🛠️ Advanced Hacking: Customize Your BlockAGI

BlockAGI is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing you to create a research assistant that fits your specific needs. Here are some ways you can hack your own BlockAGI:

## 🎚️ Level 1: Set Objectives and Run

For most users, simply setting the research objectives and running BlockAGI will be enough. Follow the `quick-start` guide to get BlockAGI up and running in 5 minutes, no technical experience required.

## 🧰 Level 2: Add Custom Tools

BlockAGI uses LangChain's tool standard, allowing you to easily build your own tools to extend its capabilities. Check out [🔧 Building Tools for BlockAGI](/docs/BUILDING_TOOLS.md) for more detail.

## 🌐 Level 5: Contribute to BlockAGI or Create Your Own Fork

Once you've customized BlockAGI to your needs, consider sharing your work with the world. You could contribute to the BlockAGI codebase, or create a domain-specific fork of BlockAGI.
